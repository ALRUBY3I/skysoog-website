## Deployment Instructions

### 1. GitHub Deployment

Since your website is hosted on GitHub (https://github.com/ALRUBY3I/skysoog-website), you can deploy the updated website by:

1. Creating a fork of your repository (optional backup step)
2. Uploading the new and modified files to your repository
3. Committing the changes

### 2. Manual Deployment

If you prefer to manually upload files to your web server:

1. Upload the entire package to your web server, maintaining the directory structure
2. Ensure the thank you pages are accessible at:
   - English: https://skysoog.com/thank-you.html
   - Arabic: https://skysoog.com/ar/thank-you.html

### 3. Form Configuration

Make sure your contact forms are configured to redirect to the appropriate thank you page after submission:
- English form should redirect to: https://skysoog.com/thank-you.html
- Arabic form should redirect to: https://skysoog.com/ar/thank-you.html

## Testing After Deployment

After deploying, please verify:

1. Both thank you pages load correctly with all styling and images
2. The back buttons on both pages work correctly
3. Form submissions redirect to the appropriate thank you page
4. Pages display properly on both desktop and mobile devices
